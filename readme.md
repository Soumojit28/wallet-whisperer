# 🤖 Wallet Whisperer
## 🌟 Project Tagline
🔗 Seamlessly Message Wallets in Discord, Anonymously and Securely.

## 📄 Description
🚀 The Web3 Wallet Whisperer Bot is an innovative tool designed to enable users to communicate wallet-to-wallet on Discord while keeping their Discord IDs private. This bot integrates cutting-edge web3 technology directly into the Discord experience.

## 🚀 How It Works
- Registration: 🆕 Users initiate the registration process by using the /register command. This command creates a unique NFT that serves as a digital identity, linking the user to their Discord ID.
- Secure Mapping: 🔒 The user's Discord ID is securely mapped to their wallet address and stored on the blockchain. This mapping is encrypted to ensure privacy and security.
- Messaging: 💬 Users can utilize the /message function to send messages to others using wallet addresses, eliminating the need for Discord IDs.
## 🤔 Problem Statement
💡 In the world of web3 and crypto, communication between wallet owners is often fragmented, requiring the use of multiple platforms and compromising user privacy. Traditional methods expose user identities and lack integration with widely-used communication platforms like Discord.

## ✅ Solution
🌉 The Web3 Wallet Messenger Bot addresses this issue by providing a secure and integrated solution for wallet-to-wallet communication within Discord. By leveraging NFTs for identity verification and encrypting user data on the blockchain, it ensures both privacy and ease of use, all within the familiar environment of Discord.
